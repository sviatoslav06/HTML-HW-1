        <h4>Linear Equations</h4>
        <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
        <div class="formula">
            <samp>ax + b = 0</samp>
        </div>
        <p>where <span class="red_letter">a</span> and <span class="red_letter">b</span> are real numbers and <span
                class="red_letter">x</span> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear
            equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not
            be an <span class="red_letter">x</span> so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <span
                class="red_letter">x</span> there.
        </p>

        <h4>Quadratic Equation</h4>
        <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
        <div class="formula">
            <samp>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0 </samp>
        </div>
        <p>where <span class="red_letter">a</span>, <span class="red_letter">b</span>, <span class="red_letter">c</span>
            are known values and <span class="red_letter">x</span> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet).
            Also, <span class="red_letter">a</span> can't be 0.
        </p>

        <h4>The area of a circle (A)</h4>
        <p><span class="red_letter">&#8508;</span> times the radius (<span class="red_letter">r</span>) squared:
        </p>
        <div class="formula">
            <samp>A = &#8508; &times; r<sup>2</sup> </samp>
        </div>
        <p>or, when you know the diameter (<span class="red_letter">D</span>):</p>
        <div class="formula">
            <samp>A = (&#8508; / 4) &times; D<sup>2</sup></samp>
        </div>
        <p>or, when you know the circumference (<span class="red_letter">C</span>):</p>
        <div class="formula">
            <samp>A = C<sup>2</sup> / 4 &times; &#8508; </samp>
        </div>

        <h4>Intersection</h4>
        <p>The intersection of two sets <span class="red_letter">A</span> and <span class="red_letter">B</span>, denoted
            by A &cap; B, is the set of all objects that are members of
            both the sets A and B. In symbols,
        </p>
        <div class="formula">
            <samp>A &cap; B = { x : x &isin; A and x &isin; B } </samp>
        </div>
        <p>That is, <span class="red_letter">x</span> is an element of the intersection A &cap; B if and only if <span
                class="red_letter">x</span> is both an element of <span class="red_letter">A</span> and an
            element of <span class="red_letter">B</span>.</p>
    </div>
