        <h1>Vehicle</h1>
        <p>A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<sup>[1]</sup>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. Vehicles
            include
            wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams),
            watercraft
            (ships, boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters)
            and
            spacecraft.<sup>[2]</sup></p>
        <p>Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground:
            wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation,
            for
            road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<sup>[3]</sup></p>
